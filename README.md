Smart Card Removinator
======================

The Smart Card Removinator is a hardware device designed for automation of
smart card testing with physical tokens.  Testing with physical tokens often
requires smart cards to by removed and inserted from the card reader to trigger
things like screen locking, or simply to test multiple models of tokens or with
different certificates.  This type of testing is usually handled manually when
testing with emulated tokens is not desirable.

The Smart Card Removinator is essentially a smart card switch that is
controlled via a RS-232 serial interface.  It allows for 8 smart cards to be
switched to a single output that is connected to a card reader.  This allows
token insertion and removal events to be automated for multiple tokens.

Hardware
--------

The hardware for the Smart Card Removinator is composed of two components:
a controller and a reader adapter.

### Controller
The controller is based on an Arduino (Atmel ATmega32U4) microcontroller.  The
microcontroller provides the USB interface that is used to interface with the
computer that drives the controller.  The microcontroller also handles
communication with the various ICs that are used in the controller.

The heart of the controller is the switching circuit that is used to actually
switch between the pyhsical smart cards.  Switching is handled by a set of
analog multiplexer ICs are used to switch the contacts of the 8 controller
card slots to a single output that connects to the card reader contacts via a
card adapter.  One 8:1 multiplexer is used for each contact of the smart card,
allowing for 8 total cards that can be switched.  The logic control pins of the
multiplexer ICs are tied together so they are controlled consistently from the
same signals.  The controller uses Maxim MAX4638 multiplexer ICs, whose
switching behavior is controlled by the microcontroller via 4 digital logic
pins.

The card slots/connectors used on the controller feature a switch that is used
to detect if a card is present or not.  The firmware uses these for error
checking (selecting a card slot that is not populated) and for status
reporting.  The controller uses a parallel-in, serial-out (PISO) shift register
that the microcontroller interfaces with via Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).
This allows us to simultaneously read the state of all 8 card slots while using
a minimum number of control pins.

The controller features a 7-segment display that is used to indicate the
currently selected card slot.  The display is controlled via a serial-in,
parallel-out (SIPO) shift register that the microcontroller interfaces with via
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).  This allows us to simultaneously turn on
the required display segments while using a minimum number of control pins.

#### Schematics
Electrical schematics for the controller are available in the _schematics_
directory.  They are provided in SVG format.  The controller is spread across
3 schematics to keep the images at a reasonable size for printing.  Labels are
used to show where connections are made between components on different
schematics (or even within a single schematic to simplify things visually).

All of the schematics are also displayed below for convenience.  You can click
on the images to display a larger version.

The following schematic contains the microcontroller connector, the display
circuit, and the card socket presence circuit.

The following schematic contains the smart card sockets as well as the A-to-B
board connectors (described in more detail in the PCBs section below).  This
schematic is really only useful for understanding the pinout of these
connectors.

[![Controller sockets](https://nkinder.github.io/images/smart-card-removinator/controller-sockets.svg "Controller sockets")][controller-sockets]

#### PCBs
The controller is made up of 2 PCBs, which stack on top of each other.  They
are connected via 2 24-pin header connectors.  The bottom board is referred to
as the A board, and the top board as the B board.  It is designed this way to
keep the PCB footprint from getting too large, as the physical size of the
smart card slots would cause a single board design to be fairly long depending
on the layout.  Each board has 4 smart card slots arranged across the front
edge of the board.

Board A contains the following components/circuits:

  * Microcontroller (USB port)
  * Reader adapter RJ45 port
  * Multiplexer circuits
  * Card presence circuits
  * Card slots 5-8

Board B contains the following components/circuits:

  * Display circuits and display
  * Card slots 1-4

The _pcbs_ directory contains Gerber RS-274-X formatted files for both of the
controller PCBs.  The file extensions describe which layer a file is for.  The
extensions map to the layers as follows:

  * .top - top copper
  * .bot - bottom copper
  * .smt - top solder mask
  * .smb - bottom solder mask
  * .slk - top silk screen
  * .oln - pcb outline
  * .dri - drill file

The Gerber files should allow you to have the PCBs manufactured by most any
PCB fabrication house.  If you want to view the Gerber files, gerbv is a good
open source option.  Another option if you want to make design changes is
KiCad, which is a full electronic design automation (EDA) software suite that
includes a Gerber viewer.

Here is an image of the board A design that was generated from the Gerber files
using gerbv.  The top copper layer is red, the bottom copper layer is green,
the drill layer is black, and the silkscreen and outline layers are white

### Card Reader Adapter
The card reader adapter is a simple PCB that has contact pads in the standard
locations described in ISO 7816, which are connected to a RJ45 jack via traces.
It is important that the reader adapter uses a .031" thick PCB, otherwise it
may not fit into the slot of your smart card reader.  The card reader adapter
stays inserted in the card reader, and is connected to the controller via a
standard ethernet cable.

Most card readers also use an internal switch to detect if a card is physically
inserted.  This is used to trigger insertion and removal events in the smart
card reader drivers that operating systems use.  Since the controller
electronically switches cards, insertion and removal events will not be
triggered.  The controller can use a logic pin to control the switch in the
card reader, despite the fact that the card reader adapter stays inserted.
This requires minor modifications to the card reader, which are described in
the _Card Reader Modifications_ section below.

Here is a schematic of the card reader adapter, which can also be found in the
_schematics_ directory (click for a larger version):

[![Card Reader Adapter](https://nkinder.github.io/images/smart-card-removinator/card-reader-adapter.svg "Card Reader Adpater")][card-reader-adapter]

Gerber RS-274-X files exist for the card reader adapter in the _pcbs_
directory.  The file extensions map to the PCB layers using the same
naming scheme as used for the controller PCBs.

Here is an image of the card reader adapter PCB design:

### Enclosure
A SVG file to create a very simple enclosure is included in the _enclosure_
directory.  The design is for two identical transparent acrylic plates, which
are used as a base and a top.  Transparent acrylic will allow the display to be
visible through the top plate.  The SVG file includes a labeled 1" square as a
scaling reference, which is required by some laser cutting shops when using SVG
files.

Here is an image of a completed controller in it's enclosure, which was made
from 6mm thick acrylic (click for a larger version):

[![Controller Enclosure](https://nkinder.github.io/images/smart-card-removinator/controller-enclosure.png "Controller Enclosure")][controller-enclosure]

In addition to the acrylic plates, the following components (or similar
equivalents) can be used to complete the enclosure:

* (12) Bivar 911-450
  * Nylon spacers for PCB mounting (.450" length, .250" OD, .125" ID)
* (4) McMaster-Carr 92005A140
  * Mounting screws (M3 x 60mm x 0.5mm pitch)
* (4) McMaster-Carr 94000A330
  * Acorn nuts (M3 x 0.5mm pitch)
* (4) McMaster-Carr 9540K841
  * Rubber feet (.500" OD, .250" tall, .125" ID)

Note that the above screws will need to be trimmed to be about 5mm shorter to
allow the assembly to tighten together properly.

### Card Reader Modifications
The internal switch in many card readers that is used to detect if a card is
physically present is usually a normally closed (NC) switch.  This means that
the switch is typically connected to ground when no card is present, and the
connection is broken when a card is inserted.  This allows us to use a common
2N3904 bipolar NPN transistor across both sides of the switch, which can
simulate closing the switch even when the card reader adapter is inserted.  The
firmware uses digital I/O pin 8 on the microcontroller to control the state of
the transistor.

Here is a schematic of the required card reader modification, which can also be
found in the _schematics_ directory (click for a larger version):

[![Card Reader Mod](https://nkinder.github.io/images/smart-card-removinator/card-reader-mod.svg "Card Reader Mod")][card-reader-mod]

The current revision of the controller PCB does not provide a socket that can
be used to connect to the card reader.  A short cable with an in-line socket
can be soldered to the top of microcontroller or to the bottom of controller
board A for the proper pin.  A future version of the PCB will add an on-board
socket.

Similarly, the card reader will need to be modified to have a cable that
connects to the cable added to the controller.  Inside of the reader, the
transistor and resistor to limit the current to the transistor base will need
to be soldered and arranged to fit inside of the housing.  The cable conductor
should be connected to the resistor.

Below are some images of a HID OMNIKEY 3121 smart card reader that has been
modified as described above.  This first image shows where the switch contacts
are located on an unmodified reader:

[![OMNIKEY Pads](https://nkinder.github.io/images/smart-card-removinator/omnikey3121-pads.png "OMNIKEY Pads")][omnikey-pads]

This image shows the addition of a transistor and resistor as shown in the
previous schematic.  With some bending and trimming of the transistor leads,
the modification can be made to easily fit.  The white wire is from the cable
connected to the controller, which is soldered to the resistor lead on the left
side of the image, which in turn is connected to the base lead of the
transistor.  This wire leads to the digital I/O pin on the microcontroller.

Here is an image of the reassembled smart card reader, which now has an
additional cable that connects to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller:

Firmware
--------

The firmware for the microcontroller implements a RS-232 command protocol that
can be used over the USB interface to control the controller.  A command must
be sent in an envelope, which means that it must be prefixed with a '#'
character and terminated with a carriage return ('\r').  The current list of
supported commands (as provided by the usage command output) is as follows:

```
--- Smart Card Removinator (v1.0.1) ---
Command Format:
        Prefix:         #
        Terminator:     \r
Commands:
        SCN     Insert card N (where N is 1-8)
        REM     Remove inserted card
        LOCKN   Lock card slot N (where N is 1-8)
        UNLOCKN Unlock card slot N (where N is 1-8)
        STA     Return card socket status
        DBG     Toggle debugging output
        ?       Show usage information
```

The command responses are terse to limit the amount of data sent over the
serial port, but they provide enough detail to indicate success or uniquely
identify common errors.

If an illegal command is entered (missing envelope, unknown command, etc.),
[one of the `ERR` responses](firmware/removinator/removinator.ino) is returned.

On success, all commands return `OK`.

The `REM` command will always return a response of `OK`.  Using this command
when no card is currently selected is a no-op and is not considered an error.

The `STA` command response returns a JSON object that represents the status of
the controller and its card slots.  
It is composed of

* The `current` attribute contains the slot number of the currently selected
  card.
* The `present` attribute contains an array of card slot numbers that have
  a card present.
* The `locked` attribute contains an array of card slots that are locked.

For example:

```json
{"current":4,"present":[1,2,3,4,5,6],"locked":[3]}
```

If no card is currently selected, the "current" card will be reported as 0.  
If no card is present or locked, the respective array will be `[]`.

The `DBG` command toggles debugging output on or off.  It can return the
following responses:

  * _DBG_ON_
    * Debug output is now enabled.
  * _DBG_OFF_
    * Debug output is now disabled.

Note that if debug output is enabled, debugging messages will be returned as a
part of the responses for the above commands in addition to the normal
responses.  Debug output responses will always be prefied by `[DBG]`, as can be
seen in the following example response to the `SC1` command:

```
[DBG] Received command "SC1"
[DBG] Received status: 0
ERR_NOCARD
```

The `?` command responds with the usage information that is shown above.  It is
intended for interactive use of the controller via a terminal.
